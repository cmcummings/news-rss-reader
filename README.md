Reads, organizes, and formats news RSS feeds.
* Uses Javascript/JSX with React and Bootstrap (for CSS styling)
* Separates feeds by category (e.g. World, Tech, U.S., Business).
* Pulls from multiple online news sources:
  * [New York Times](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/index.html)
  * [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/news/rss-news-and-feeds)
  * [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/help/feeds)

### Usage (development)
